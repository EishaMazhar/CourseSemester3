>>> Review:

i) CPU/uP is a complex digital circuit which executes instructions.
ii) Instructions are processed using Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycles.

>>> Topics covered:

1. Memory 
   a) Number of location in memory (size of address bus). E.g. 1024 memory
      locations need 10 bits wide address bus.
   b) Size of each loction in memory (size of data bus). E.g. 8-bit wide data item. 
   c) Control signal(s) for reading and writing data to memory
   d) block diagram of memory chip (address, data and control busses)
   e) Memory Write cycle (Supply address, supply data, assert Read signal)
   f) Memroy Read cycle (Supply address, assert read signal, 
      memory places data on databus).

2. How to implement Fetech-Decode-Execute within a CPU/uP?
   a) Instruction Pointer (IP) register generates instruction memory address and
      places it on the address bus connected to memory
   b) Instructions are received from memory using data bus in the Instruction
      Register (IR)
   c) The decoder decodes instruction in IR and generates control signals to execute
      each instructions. This way CPU recognizes differnt instructions and their
      operands (i.e. are they in registers or memory).
   >>> Control Unit consist of IP, IR, and decoder including control signals <<<
   d) CPU Registers. CPU registers give fast access to data (1-2 nano seconds) as
      compaired to memory (40 - 80 nano seconds). However, they are limited in 
      number ~100 of register per CPU core. Memory is usually unlimited (~100 GBs)
   e) ALU performs Arithmatic and Logic Unit operations based on the type of
      instruction. The resulting data is saved either in register or memory.

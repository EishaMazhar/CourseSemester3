1. Programer's view of the Computer System 
   a) digital logic represent the building block like adders, MUXs, Decoders,
      shiftregister, counters, etc.
   b) micro-architecture = control path + data path. It fetchs and execute 
      instructions.
   c) instrution set archtiecture (IAS) exposes the micro-architecture (hardware)
      for programming. It specifies how a processor micro-architecture functions
      by running differnt instructions that use differnt registers. How
      instructions access memory locations, etc.
   d) Operating System (OS) provides various services based on CPU and other input
      output devices (e.g PC or Raspberry Pi). It explolits many ISA features which
      are not accessable to other users through HLL or Assembly.
   e) HLLs or Assembly programs use OS to load and execute them. 

2. A running program has three portions: code, data and stack. OS assigns 
   physical memory addresses for each portion of your program. Each time you run
   our HLL or Assembly program, the starting memory address of each of these 
   portions might change.

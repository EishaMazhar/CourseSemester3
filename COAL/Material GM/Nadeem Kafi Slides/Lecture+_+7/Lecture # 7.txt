1. Address Bus and Data Bus
   a) size of data bus determine the processing capability in bits of a uP
   b) size of address bus determine the size of addressable external memory (RAM)
   c) 1000 numbers in a 8 bits representaiton takes 1000 bytes in byte memory. while,
      1000 numbers in a 64 bit representation need 8 times more memory. 
   d) Address bus bits represents the number of memory locations (in the power of 2).

2. Operating System component called loader loads your compiled machine code from
   storage device into memory. It assigs segment address for code, data and stack
   in CS, DS and SS segments respectively. 

3. Logical vs Physical address. 
   a) CS:IP is the logical address. This address is a combination of CS register
      and IP register. Logical address is internally with in the process. 
      (e.g. AF10:00BC if CS=AF10, IP=00BC)
   b) The 20 bit physical address in 8086 is generated by shifting CS register 
      4 bit left and adding the offset register. This address appears on the
      address bus pins of the microprocessor.

4. Writing Assembly programs
   a) label: Mnemonics operand1, operand2    ; comments
   b) Conditional jump using CMP and JLE/JE/JGE etc.
   c) NOP

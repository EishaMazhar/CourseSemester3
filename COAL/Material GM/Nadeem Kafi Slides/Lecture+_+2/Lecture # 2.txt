Topics covered:

1. Generating Machine code
   a) HLL to Machine code
   b) Assembly to Machine code
2. Converting C language expression to Assembly code
   a) variables 
   b) registers
3. Memory organization 
   a) addresses
   b) data (of various sizes)
4. Memory contains both program and data 
   a) draw a memory starting from 0000 and ending at 00ff
5. Microprocess(uP)/CPU is a very complex digital circuit for executing machine code    (instructions).
   a) fetch-decode-execute-save results to memory cycle
   b) decoding is necessary so that the uP decides which operation need to be 
      performed on what operands.
   c) A uP has a large number of instructions and the uP vendor provides a 
      instructions set manual to enable the programmer to know about available
      instructions.

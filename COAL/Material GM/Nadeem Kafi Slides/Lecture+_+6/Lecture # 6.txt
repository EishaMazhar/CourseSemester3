>>> Read chapter # 2 topics covered so far 

>>> Topics covered:

1. ADD instructions with two or three operands
   a) Most of the x86 instructions have two operands
   b) Non x85 ISA have three operands like ADD R0, R1, R2
   c) Operations: ADD, SUB, IDIV, IMUL, XOR, AND, OR, SHR, SHL, ROL, ROR, etc.

2. Flag register
   a) carry flag
   b) Overflow flag
   c) Zero flag
   d) Sign flag

3. Working or General purpose Registers
   a) AX, BX, CX, DX
   b) These also have special purpose like CX is counter.
  
4. Pointer Registers
   a) Intructions pointer (IP)
   b) Data pointers (EBX, ESI, EDI)
   c) Stack Pointer (SP)

5. Segment Registers
   a) CS Code Segment
   b) DS and ES as Data segemnt and Extra (data) segment
   c) SS Stack Segment
   d) There are other segment registers as well.

6. How segment register and Pointer register makes a logical address?
   a) CS:IP pointes to Code segment in memory
   b) DS:BX, DS:SI, DS:DI, ES:BX, ES:SI, ES:DI points to data segments
   c) SS:SP is the stack pointer and points to top of the stack
   d) Memory address = Segment (or base) address + Offset (given by pointer register)
